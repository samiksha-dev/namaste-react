//now you see that we do root.render which means we want to render this root in our <div id="root"></div>
//but what if we already have something <div id="root"><h1>Samiksha is here</h1></div>
//now what will happen so the answer is this Samiksha is here will get replaced even if you have 5 othertags as well still it will get replaced by the lines above root.render



//why react is a library and not a framework because it can be applied to even just a small portion of a page for eg. just on header or sidebar or navbar
