<!-- since react not only works on browsers but have in our mobiles using react native in our watches so that is we need different variant of react and that is why we need line 14-->
<!-- if you write in console REACTDOM you will see various functions/methods that react dom provides us -->



<!-- Rendering things in browser using react -->
<!-- step 1 we need to create the element -->
<!-- <script>
    const heading=React.createElement("h1",{},"Hello from React!!!");
    // so this contains three arguments first the element that we want to create second an empty object and third is what we want to show
    // now second step is to create a root inside which everything will be rendered and this is the work od DOM and we have to create it in the root dic 
    const root=ReactDOM.createRoot(doocument.getElementById("root"));
    //and now we can render our heading inside this root
    root.render(heading);
</script> -->

<!-- now lets just put this code in a seperate js file and then use it here -->
<!-- <script src="./App4.js"></script> -->
<script src="./App5.js"></script>
